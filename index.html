        <p>I'm currently a student at Bluegrass Community Technical College studying
          in Medical Information Technology. After graduating in May 2021, I'll be
          continuing my studies at Bellevue University in their Web Development
          Bachelor's program. Originally I had planned on pursuing a career in the
          healthcare field. This quickly changed once I found out how fun it was to
          write computer code. I'm taking the Udemy Web Development course to get a
          head-start on the information to be covered in college.</p></td>
